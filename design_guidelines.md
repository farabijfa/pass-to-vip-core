# Backend API Project - No Visual Design Guidelines Needed

## Project Classification

This is a **backend API system** with no frontend components or user interface. The project consists of:

- Node.js/Express REST API endpoints
- Supabase PostgreSQL database integration
- PassKit and PostGrid service integrations
- Service/Controller architecture pattern

## Traditional Design Guidelines Don't Apply

Since this is a pure backend API project, traditional visual design guidelines (typography, layout, colors, spacing) are not applicable. There are no web pages, user interfaces, or visual components to design.

## Relevant Guidelines for Backend APIs

Instead of visual design, focus on these API design principles:

### API Response Structure
- Consistent JSON response format across all endpoints
- Clear error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Standardized success/error response schemas

### API Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- Clear request/response examples
- Authentication requirements clearly documented

### Developer Experience
- Intuitive endpoint naming conventions
- RESTful resource patterns
- Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages

### Monitoring & Health
- `/health` endpoint for system status
- Structured logging for debugging
- Performance metrics tracking

**Note**: If you intended to build a frontend dashboard or admin interface for this loyalty system, please clarify those requirements separately, and I'll provide appropriate visual design guidelines for that interface.
