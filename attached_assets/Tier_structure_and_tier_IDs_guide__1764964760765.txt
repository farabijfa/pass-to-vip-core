Introduction
Whether you’re building a loyalty program to reward customers or a membership program to manage access and benefits, Tiers are a powerful tool for organizing and customizing your program. Tiers allow you to segment users into distinct groups, each with its own unique design, benefits, and features. This ensures a personalized experience for every member or customer, while maintaining a cohesive and scalable program structure.


 


In this article, we’ll explore what tiers are, how they differ from projects, and how they can be used effectively in both loyalty and membership programs.


 


 


What is a Tier?
A Tier is a subcategory within a program that allows you to create distinct designs, benefits, and experiences for different groups of users. Tiers are ideal for organizing users based on criteria such as:


Loyalty levels (e.g., entry-level, mid-tier, VIP)


Membership levels (e.g., weekday-only, 7-day access, VIP)


Roles (e.g., staff, trainers, members)


Access levels (e.g., standard, 24/7 access, family access)


Geographic regions (e.g., local, national, international customers)


Each tier can have its own unique design elements, including:


Colors: Different color schemes to visually distinguish tiers.


Images: Custom logos, backgrounds, or icons tailored to the tier.


Fields: Specific data fields relevant to the tier (e.g., points balance, membership type, access hours).


Tiers operate independently within the same project, meaning changes to one tier do not affect others. This flexibility allows you to cater to diverse user groups while maintaining a cohesive program structure.


 


 


Tiers vs. Projects: What’s the Difference?
To understand tiers better, it’s important to distinguish them from Projects.


 


What is a Project?
A Project is a high-level container that represents a distinct program or use case. Each project is designed to serve a specific purpose and typically has its own unique set of passes, designs, and configurations.


 


Example: Loyalty Program vs. Membership Program
Loyalty Program Project:


Purpose: Rewards customers for their engagement and purchases.


Features: Includes fields like customer name, points balance, QR codes for rewards redemption, and tier status.


Design: Focused on branding and tier differentiation (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold).


Membership Program Project:


Purpose: Manages access and benefits for members.


Features: Includes fields like member name, membership type, access hours, and QR codes for entry.


Design: Optimized for easy identification and access control.


What is a Tier?
A Tier is a subcategory within a project that allows for further customization and segmentation. Tiers are used to differentiate groups of users within the same program.


 


 


Examples of Tiers
 


1: Loyalty Program Tiers
Within a Retail Loyalty Program, tiers might include:


Bronze Tier:


Entry-level tier for new customers.


Design: Simple branding with minimal customization.


Benefits: Basic rewards, such as discounts on select items or birthday offers.


Silver Tier:


Mid-level tier for regular shoppers.


Design: Enhanced visuals (e.g., silver accents, additional fields like exclusive offers).


Benefits: Extra perks like free shipping, early access to sales, or bonus points on purchases.


Gold Tier:


High-level tier for loyal, high-spending customers.


Design: Premium branding (e.g., gold accents, exclusive imagery).


Benefits: Premium rewards, such as personalized shopping experiences, VIP customer service, or double points on all purchases.


Platinum Tier:


Top-tier for the most loyal and high-value customers.


Design: Luxurious branding (e.g., platinum accents, VIP imagery).


Benefits: Exclusive perks like private shopping events, concierge services, or complimentary products.


 


2: Membership Program Tiers
Within a Gym Membership Program, tiers might include:


Weekday Only Tier:


Tier for members who primarily use the gym on weekdays.


Design: Simple branding with minimal customization.


Benefits: Access to gym facilities Monday to Friday during regular hours.


7-Day Access Tier:


Tier for members who want full access throughout the week.

Benefits: Access to gym facilities 7 days a week, including weekends.


24/7 Access Tier:


Tier for members who want unrestricted access at any time.

Benefits: 24/7 access to gym facilities, including early morning or late-night workouts.


Family Tier:

Why Use Tiers?
Customization
Deliver personalized experiences that reflect the level or role of each user.


 


Engagement
Encourage users to progress to higher tiers by offering increasingly attractive benefits.


 


Organization
Easily manage and segment users based on their loyalty level, membership type, or access level.


 


Consistency
Duplicate a perfected base tier to ensure uniformity across all tiers, saving time and effort.


 


Scalability
Add new tiers as your program grows or evolves, without disrupting existing designs.


 


 


Best Practices for Using Tiers
Perfect Your Base Tier
Before creating new tiers, ensure your base tier is thoroughly tested and optimized. Test it in Apple Wallet and Google Wallet, and refine the design in the PassKit Pass Designer.


 


Use Descriptive Tier Names
Choose clear and intuitive names for your tiers (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold) to make them easy to identify.


 


Leverage Tier IDs
Assign unique Tier IDs to make it easier to manage and reference tiers programmatically.


 


Align Benefits with Tiers
Ensure each tier offers meaningful and incremental benefits to motivate users to upgrade.


 


Plan for Updates
Remember that changes to a tier must be applied to each tier, so plan your designs carefully to minimize future updates
